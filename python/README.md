# IPython

This is a cross between a tutorial, a checklist and a cheatsheet:

  * a summary, hopefully a memorable declarative sentence

  * a quick tutorial, ideally with some visuals and with some "layout"

  * a query

  * an action or setting

  * a "follow up", either the query again, or a test or an example (or any combination of these).

  * some observations, opinions or "lore" mixed together

  * references

    - {internally, externally} {prior, subsequent}

    - additional kinds of relationships (to be supplied)

  


## Installation

 * osx and ubuntu:

```bash
 sudo pip3 install ipython
 pip3 list | grep ipython
 ```


## Configure

Like all command line utilities, ipython can be configured by writing python code.
The configuration mechanism is quite rich.

```bash
tbs
```


## TODO

  * install %autoload
  *
